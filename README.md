# Learning tailwindCss with Rino

Tailwind is one of the most popular frameworks. It is important for today's web frontEnd to know how to use tailwind and the components it can create. In this repository documentation, I will provide free components and free explanations for all frontEnds who want to use tailwind.

It's important to note that I'm a web frontEnd guy learning tailwind and building buildable components, my documentation isn't the best but I try my best.

## What will you get in this repository?

- **Multiple responsive navbars** ready to use.
- **Responsive forms** that are easy to integrate into your project.
- **Code explanation** to understand how each component works.

## Thanks for visiting my repository, it's not the best component documentation but I try my best and keep evaluating.
